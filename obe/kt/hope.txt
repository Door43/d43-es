====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

In modern English, the term "hope" means to desire that something will happen, without being certain that it will happen.

  * In many English translations of the Bible, the term "hope" also often refers to a sure expectation of receiving what God has promised his people.
  * However, in the ULB, the term "hope" is used only when it has the modern English meaning of wanting something to happen, but not being certain that it will happen.


  * The ultimate hope is being assured of our salvation through our faith in Christ. Peter calls this our "living hope."  **[Note: is this meaning of hope always translated by "confidence" in the ULB?]

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "hope" could also be translated as "to expect" or "to trust" or "to be assured of."
  * The phrase, "nothing to hope for" could be translated as "nothing to trust in" or "no expectation of anything good."
  * To "have hope" means to "believe that something good will happen" or to "know that God will do the good things he has promised." **[This is now translated as "confidence?"]**
  * To "have no hope" means to have no assurance that anything good will happen."


  * "A living hope" could be translated by, "a sure expectation of being saved" or "God's sure promise that we will live with him forever." **[now translated by confidence]**
  * The phrase "Christ Jesus our hope" could be translated by, "Christ Jesus whom we are expecting (to save us)" or "Christ Jesus who we are confident will save us." **[now translated by confidence]**
